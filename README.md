# Instacart-Basket-Analysis

Project Overview

Several datasets are used for Instacart to wrangle and analyse thereby arriving at the results. Reports are created to communicate the analysis process, results and recommendations to key business questions from Instacart.

Objective

Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. Your task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

Key Questions

 What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
 often do they return to Instacart)?
 
 Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
 
 Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

 Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
 habits?
 
 What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
 
 Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
 
 What differences can we find in ordering habits of different customer
 profiles? 
 
 Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products
 customers are ordering.

 Libraries

 The data was analysed using Python and the following libraries:

● Pandas : for data analysis

● Numpy: for mathematical equations

● Seaborn: for data visulizations

Folders

The project files are divided between the following folders:

Project Management: Project Brief and Data Dictionary.

Data: Separated into two subfolders Original Data and Prepared Data. These contains the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)

Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.

Analysis: The Visualizations folder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.

Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel.

● Matplotlib: for data visulizations

● Scipy: for data equations

● Warnings: for ignore the warnings

Folders

The project files are divided between the following folders:

Project Management: Project Brief and Data Dictionary.

Data: Two seperate files have been used. Original Data contains the raw datasets and the Prepared Dta contains the datasets after they have been cleaned, aggregated, combined and prepared for further analysis.

Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks contains the coding for the analysis.

Analysis: The Visualizations folder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.

Sent to Client: The final report submitted to Instacart in Excel.

Disclaimer

The Instacart is an existing company that has made its data available online and certain fields have been added for the purpose of the course in CareerFounry.
